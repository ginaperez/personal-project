Deploy an Ubuntu 18.04 VM on digital ocean
Through the Digital Ocean website, access the VM console
Attempt to log in as root, using the password that Digital Ocean sent via email
After pressing enter to log in as root, it will prompt you to change your password. Enter the current password, then enter a new password and enter it again to confirm
Once logged in as root, follow this guide: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04

The commands  that I ran from this guide were (executed all as root):

apt-get update
apt-get install nodejs
apt-get install npm

Then to validate everything is installed, I ran:

nodejs -v
npm -v

Next, I cloned my GitHub repository https://github.com/ginaperez/personal-project.git using the command:

git clone https://github.com/ginaperez/personal-project.git

Then, I navigated into it using:

cd personal-project

Then, I installed my node_modules by running:

npm install

However, because my Digital Ocean VM (aka Droplet) only has 1GB of RAM, npm install failed and it got killed (by the operating system). I tried it again and it seems to have worked the second time. I was prepared to resize the Droplet to 2GB RAM if it continued to fail.

Then, I had to install nodemon:

npm install -g nodemon

Then I ran nodemon, but it failed with this error:
